1. Open the MenuSystem in eclipse.
2. Run the example.ExampleSetup.java file. This will launch two menu servers, the actor interface and the GUI for adding items to a menu.
    * The external dependency's should work out of the box but if not the project requires the library's contained in the root folder of the project.
3. Run the iOS app in an emulator and point it to "http://localhost:9000/menus".
4. Point the GUI to either "http://localhost:9001/menu" or "http://localhost:9002/menu" to add an item to either restaurants menu. It will point to "http://localhost:9001/menu" (Pi's menu) by default
